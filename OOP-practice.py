# Watto needs a new system for organizing his inventory of podracers. 
# Help him do this by implementing an Object Oriented solution according to the following criteria.

# First, he'll need a general Podracer class defined with max_speed, condition (perfect, trashed, repaired) and price attributes. 





  # Define a repair() method that will update the condition of the podracer to "repaired".





# Define a new class, AnakinsPod that inherits the Podracer class, but also contains a special method called boost that will multiply max_speed by 2.






# Define another class that inherits Podracer and call this one SebulbasPod. 
# This class should have a special method called flame_jet that will update the condition of another podracer to "trashed".
